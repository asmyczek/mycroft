<h2>References</h2>

<p>A reference refers to a <a href="/values.html">value</a> at a point
  in time, and acts as an identity. Your bank account balance is a
  reference, but at any point in time it has a specific, immutable value.</p>

<p>References can be observed in a generic way, without requiring
coordination with other parties. This implies that all references
  guarantee atomic transitions between values. Some references may
  make additional concurrency-related promises as well.</p>

<p>Some example references:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="/vars/mycroft.examples/a-ref">reference to a vector</a></li>
<li>Recent <a href="/vars/mycroft.examples/browse-history">history</a> of web requests to /vars</li>
</ul>
