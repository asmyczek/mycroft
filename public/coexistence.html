<h2>Coexistence</h2>

<p>Programming with <a href="/values.html">values</a>
  and <a href="/references.html"> references</a> is liberating, but most of the JVM
  world doesn't work that way yet. In Java, and most other JVM
  languages, there
  is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203475/how-do-i-identify-immutable-objects-in-java">no
  way to tell</a> if an object is a value or a reference. And in fact,
  most JVM objects are neither! As a result, reading values from an
  arbitrary Java object requires coordination through a different
  specific API for every object.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do in this situation is get out of APIs as
  quickly as possible, converting specific objects into generic data as
  soon as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent <a href="/vars/mycroft.examples/browse-history">history</a>
  of web requests to /vars</li>
<li><a href="/vars/mycroft.examples.xml/xml-example">XML data</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A few Java classes are known to be values. Even in these cases, you
  are often better off converting them to generic data. Some examples
  include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java <a href="http://localhost:8080/vars/mycroft.examples/some-strings?selector=%5B%3Amycroft.data%2Fderef+0+%3Amycroft.data%2Freflect%5D">reflection</a></li>
</ul>
